- Internationalization .. :-D
- Update next round when pairing is clear immediately (greyed out for 1/8 final when not sure)
- Improve elo-based simulation model which is very simplistic (regular pairings, as well as extra time, penalties ...)
- Fix TODOs
- Allow fine-tuning of progress (individual goals <--> skip over entire phases)
- session-spanning stats, hence persistence (?!)

DONE

- Show "n.V.", (n.E.)
